I am an Electrical Engineering Major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in 2028 or 2029.

## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs 

Lab 3 Part 1

I really enjoyed working on this lab because it involved calculating the BMR of a man and woman with the Mifflin St Jeor equation. It was the first time we used double command to be able to insert numbers into the equation so it could calculate the BMR using the Mifflin St Jeor equation. I had been struggling to learn how std::cout << and std::cin >> functioned since I had been struggling to understand the concept. Since we were trying to get the equation to produce the data such as weight, height , and age. I learned that for us to get the data we would use std::cout << to insert the numeric value of what we wanted to call forth and std::cin >> would produce and display the final piece of data we wanted. 

Lab 4 Part 1 

I really enjoyed working on this lab with my partner because it was similar to Lab 3 so translating the experience we had from Lab 3 to Lab 4 was really amazing. We were tasked to calculate using units provided the conversion of ml to tps to tbsp to oz to finally cups. I found it really interesting because I was used to doing conversions mathematically myself but since I was able to experience constructing code that would convert units it was something new and I found it really fun. 

Lab 12 

Lab 12 was the Lab I felt most challenged with but the experience of making my first animation was an accomplishment. I remember when the semester started in August and we were told that at the end of the semester we would make a gif color image for our final lab assignment. I felt most challenged when figuring out how to call forth the colors individually because I had to provide a path for the file and call for the files individually and in the end bring them together to produce the rainbow color image we wanted to create.
